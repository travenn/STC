# STC
[S]imple [T]orrent [C]reator  

coded with Qt 5.7 on linux but should work on all platforms.  
Binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/travenn/STC/releases).
  
  
### Special Features
* Name changing (I really hate those files in "New Folder").
* Saves used announce / webseed urls so you don't have to c&p them all the time.
* Optionally set any arbitrary data you want to support client extensions (or just cause you can).
* Gives you the metainfo size before hashing (never fear limits for .torrent file size on trackers).
* Can read torrent files, either to alter them or just to see what's in it.
* Duplicate a torrent with altering it's hash (to avoid "illegal cross-seeding" on multiple private trackers).
* Scripting compatible hash comparison to check for duplicates.
* Can be used as GUI or commandline tool.
* About as fast as mktorrent (2x-3x faster than some torrent clients)
