# STC
[S]imple [T]orrent [C]reator  

coded with Qt 5.7 on linux but should work on all platforms.  
  
  
### Special Features
* Name changing (I really hate those files in "New Folder").
* Saves used announce / webseed urls so you don't have to c&p them all the time.
* Optionally set any arbitrary data you want to support client extensions (or just cause you can).
* Gives you the metainfo size before hashing (never fear limits for .torrent file size on trackers).
* Can read torrent files, either to alter them or just to see what's in it.
* Scripting compatible hash comparison to check for duplicates.
* Can be used as GUI or commandline tool.
  
  
  
#### Known issues
Windows doesn't support running GUI tools solely on the command line so i had to do some hacks.
  
  
#### How you can help
Please report any bugs (create an issue) and most importantly if you are missing any features just create an issue for it.
